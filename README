= Synopsis =
This module makes it possible to limit the total speed of simultaneous 
connections for the assigned session or as a special case, from one address.

Example configuration
<geshi lang="nginx">
http {
    limit_speed_zone   one  $binary_remote_addr  10m;

    server {
        location /download/ {
            limit_speed   one  100k;
        }
    }
}
</geshi>

= Directives =
== limit_speed_zone ==
'''syntax:''' ''limit_speed_zone zone_name $variable memory_max_size''

'''default:''' ''no''

'''context:''' ''http''

Directive describes the zone, in which the session states are stored.<BR>
The numbers of sessions is determined by the assigned variable, it depends on
the size of the used Variable and '''memory_max_size''' value.

Example of the use:

<geshi lang="nginx">
limit_speed_zone one $binary_remote_addr 10m;
</geshi>

The address of client is used as the session.
Notice that the variable <code>$binary_remote_addr</code> is used instead of 
<code>$remote_addr</code>.

The length of the values of the variable of <code>$remote_addr</code> can be 
from 7 to 15 bytes; therefore size state is equal to 32 or 64 bytes.

Length of all values of the variable of <code>$binary_remote_addr</code> is 
always 4 bytes and the size of the state is always 32 bytes.

When the zone size is 1M then it is possible to handle 32000 sessions with 
32 bytes/session.

== limit_speed ==

'''syntax:''' ''limit_speed zone_name max_speed''

'''default:''' ''no''

'''context:''' ''http, server, location''

Directive assigns the sum of maximum speed from the same IP address. For 
example, if you limit the total speed to 100KB per IP address and there
are 10 concurrent connections from the same IP, each connection speed 
is 10KB(100KB/10).
